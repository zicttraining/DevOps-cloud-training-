# To create a StatefulSet for a stateful application like Redis or RabbitMQ in Kubernetes, you can use the following declarative method. 

First, you need to define a StatefulSet in a YAML configuration file.

 Here's an example for a StatefulSet for a replicated MySQL database:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  serviceName: mysql
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: your-root-password
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306
          name: mysql
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mysql-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mysql-persistent-storage
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "your-storage-class"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

### In this example, you define a StatefulSet with the name "mysql" and specify the number of replicas, the Pod template, the container image, environment variables, ports, and volume mounts. You also define a volume claim template for persistent storage.

#### After creating the StatefulSet definition, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command.

#### This declarative method allows you to define the desired state of the StatefulSet and let Kubernetes handle the creation and management of the stateful application's Pods, including their unique identities and persistent storage
