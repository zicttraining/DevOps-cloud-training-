#### To mount a Secret or ConfigMap as a volume to a Deployment in Kubernetes, you need to define the volume and volumeMounts in the Deployment's YAML configuration file. 

Here's an example YAML configuration file for a Deployment that uses a Secret and a ConfigMap:

Here's an example of the YAML syntax:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image
        volumeMounts:
        - name: my-secret-volume
          mountPath: /etc/secret
          readOnly: true
        - name: my-config-volume
          mountPath: /etc/config
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: my-secret-volume
        secret:
          secretName: my-secret
      - name: my-config-volume
        configMap:
          name: my-configmap
Here's an example of the YAML syntax:
```

#### In this example, a Deployment named "my-deployment" is defined with a container that uses the image "my-image". The container also defines two volumes named "my-secret-volume" and "my-config-volume" that are backed by a Secret named "my-secret" and a ConfigMap named "my-configmap", respectively. The volumes are mounted at the paths "/etc/secret" and "/etc/config" in the container using the volumeMounts field. The volumes field specifies the name of the volume and its source, which is either a Secret or a ConfigMap.
