To resolve merge conflicts in Git, follow these steps:

1. Identify the conflicting files:
   git status

2. Open the conflicting file using a text editor:
    vim filename

3. Resolve the conflict by choosing which changes to keep and which to discard. The conflicting changes are marked by '<<<' and '>>>>'.

4. Manually edit the file to combine the conflicting changes.

5. Save the file and exit the text editor.

6. Stage the resolved file:
   
   git add filename

7. Commit the resolved changes:

   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

8. Push the changes to the remote repository:

  git push origin branch-name
