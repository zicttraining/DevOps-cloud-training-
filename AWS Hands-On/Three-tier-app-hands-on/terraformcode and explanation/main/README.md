Provider Configuration:

The provider block is essential for defining the cloud provider (in this case, AWS) that Terraform will use to deploy resources.
Region: region is set to "us-west-2", which means all resources will be deployed in the US West (Oregon) region. Adjust this to any other AWS region if needed for geographic or compliance purposes.

Customizations:

Changing Regions: To deploy resources in a different AWS region, replace "us-west-2" with the desired region code (e.g., "us-east-1" for US East, N. Virginia).
The provider.tf file is a foundational configuration, specifying the region and provider used for all subsequent resource deployments.
