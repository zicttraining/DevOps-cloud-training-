# To map a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) to a pod in Kubernetes, you need to define the PVC in the pod's YAML configuration file. 

Here's an example YAML configuration file for a pod that uses a PVC:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: my-image
    volumeMounts:
    - name: my-volume
      mountPath: /data
  volumes:
  - name: my-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
   ```   claimName: my-pvc
```

#### In this example, a pod named "my-pod" is defined with a container that uses the image "my-image". The pod also defines a volume named "my-volume" that is backed by the PVC named "my-pvc". The volume is mounted at the path "/data" in the container using the volumeMounts field. The volumes field specifies the name of the volume and its source, which is the PVC. The claimName field specifies the name of the PVC to use as the volume source
