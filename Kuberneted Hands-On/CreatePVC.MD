# To create a Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1.  Create a YAML configuration file for the PV. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: standard
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/data
```

2. Apply the PV configuration to your cluster using the kubectl apply command:

```
kubectl apply -f pv.yaml
```

3. Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) for your volume. For example:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
  storageClassName: standard
  volumeName: my-pv
```

4. Apply the PVC configuration to your cluster using the kubectl apply command:

```
kubectl apply -f pvc.yaml
```

#### The PV will now exist in your cluster. It will show as Available as it's unused and unclaimed. The PVC will now show as Bound because it's claimed by the PVC
