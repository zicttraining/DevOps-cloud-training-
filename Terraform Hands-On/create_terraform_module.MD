# To create a Terraform module, you can follow these steps based on the information from the search results:

1. Declare Usage of Terraform Modules:

Begin by declaring that you want to use a Terraform module in your current configuration. Use the 'module' block and provide the necessary variable values like source and version:

```
module "terraform_test_module" {
  source = "spacelift.io/your-org/terraform_test_module"
  version = "1.0.0"
  argument_1 = var.test_1
  argument_2 = var.test_2
  ...
}
```

2. Organize Module Files:

     a. Create a directory for your module, such as 'ec2-instance', and move all '.tf files' (e.g., 'main.tf', 'variables.tf', 'outputs.tf') inside it.
     
     b. The typical structure of a module directory includes 'main.tf', 'variables.tf', 'outputs.tf', and 'README.md'.
     
3. Specify Module Sources:

   a. Terraform modules can be stored locally, in a Terraform registry, or in a source control repository. The 'source' argument in the module block will vary based on the location of the module.
   
   For example, if the module is stored in a VCS like Git, the source might look like this:
   ```
   module "terraform_test_module" {
   source = "git@github.com:your-organization/the-repository-name.git?ref=1.0.0"
   ...
   }
   ```

4. Utilize Variables:

  When adding variables to your module, pay attention to their source, version, and meta-arguments to ensure proper functionality and flexibility.
  
5. Testing and Maintenance:

    a. Test your modules to ensure they function as expected and maintain them regularly to keep them up-to-date and efficient.
  
    b. Consider using dynamic blocks, ternary operators, and Terraform built-in functions to enhance your modules.
  
  
### By following these steps, you can create a Terraform module effectively, enabling you to encapsulate groups of resources dedicated to specific tasks, promote reusability, and simplify infrastructure management.
