#### To use a Terraform module in a Terraform configuration, you can follow these steps based on the search results:

1. Declare Module Usage:

    Declare that you want to use a Terraform module by using the 'module' block in your configuration file. Specify the source of the module, version, and any specific arguments required for the module:
  ```
  module "terraform_test_module" {
  source = "spacelift.io/your-org/terraform_test_module"
  version = "1.0.0"
  argument_1 = var.test_1
  argument_2 = var.test_2
  ...
}
```

    The 'source' attribute can point to a Git repository or a registry address depending on where the module is stored.
 
 
2. Module Outputs:


    To access values from resources created by the module, declare outputs within the Terraform module. This allows you to use these values in other parts of your configuration:
```
output "random_string" {
  value = aws_example_resource.example_device.random_string
  description = "A random string from an example resource on AWS."
}
```

3. Declare Provider Requirements:

     In your Terraform configuration, declare the providers you require using the required_providers block nested inside the top-level terraform block. Each provider requirement includes a local name, source location, and version constraint:
  
  ```
  terraform {
  required_providers {
    mycloud = {
      source = "mycorp/mycloud"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}
```


4. Module Development:

     a. Organize your Terraform configurations into modules for better reusability and maintainability. Modules are essentially sets of configuration files in a folder that can be reused across different environments.
  
     b. Consider creating separate modules for different sets of resources to promote code reuse and maintain clear boundaries between components.
  
##### By following these steps, you can effectively utilize Terraform modules in your configurations, enabling better organization, reusability, and scalability of your infrastructure as code.
