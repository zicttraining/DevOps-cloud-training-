#### Route 53

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to creating a DNS record sets 

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, you will be able to;

- create record sets

- manage the domain name routing


## Outline

- Part 1 - Prep.
- Part 2 - Getting familiar with Public Hosted Zone, SOA, NS.  
- Part 3 - Creating A record set
- Part 4 - Creating CNAME record set
- Part 4 - Creating an Alias record set

## Part 1 - Prep.

### STEP 1: Create Sec.Group:

```bash
   Route 53 Sec: In bound : "SSH 22, HTTP 80  > anywhere(0:/00000)"
```
### STEP 2: Create Instances:

- We'll totally create "2" instances.
   
 1. Create EC2 that is installed httpd user data in default VPC named "N.virginia_1"

```bash
Region: "N.Virginia"
VPC: Default VPC
Subnet: PublicA
Sec Group: "Route 53 Sec"

user data: 

#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
yum install -y wget
cd /var/www/html
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

```

2. Create EC2 that is installed httpd user data in default VPC "N.virginia_2"
```bash
Region: "N.Virginia"
VPC: Default VPC
Subnet: PublicA
Sec Group: "Route 53 Sec"

user data:

#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
yum install -y wget
cd /var/www/html
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd

```

### STEP 3: Create Static WebSite Hosting :

 1. Create Static WebSite Hosting-1/ "www.[your sub-domain name].net"
 
  - Go to S3 service and create a bucket with sub-domain name: "www.[your sub-domain name].net"
  - Public Access "Enabled"
  - Upload Files named "index.html" and "sorry.jpg" in "s3.bucket.www" folder
  - Permissions>>> Bucket Policy >>> Paste bucket Policy

```bash
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17", 
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::(don't forget to change me)/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
### STEP 4: Create Auto Scaling and ALB with CloudFormation Template :

- Go the Cloudformation console and create a stack based on the template seen below.
- Use upload from your computer.

## Part 2 - Getting familiar with Route 53 Public Hosted Zone, SOA, NS. 
Explain that Public hosted Zone and permanent records SOA nad NS. 
             you may also transfer the SOA ans NS records
             you may also create Private Hosted zone. 

## Part 3 - Creating A Record Sets 

### STEP 1 : Create A Record with "www" subdomain:

- Go to Route 53 service

- Click hosted zones on the left hand menu

- click your Domain name's public hosted zone

- click "create record"

- select "simple routing" ---> Next

- click "Define simple record"

- Create A record with N. Virginia_1

```bash
Record Name:"www"
Value/Route traffic to: 
  - select "IP address or another value depending the record type" option 
      - enter IP of the "N.Virginia_1" EC2
Record Type : A
Type: "A â€“ IPv4 address"
Alias:"No"
TTL:"1m"
```
- Select newly created record's flag and hit the "create record" tab seen bottom

### STEP 2 : Create another "A record" with N. Virginia_1 with "info" subdomain

- Go to Route 53 service

- Click hosted zones on the left hand menu

- click your Domain name's public hosted zone

- click "create record"

- select "simple routing" ---> Next

- click "Define simple record"

- Create A record with N. Virginia_1

```bash
Record Name:"info"
Value/Route traffic to: 
  - select "IP address or another value depending the record type" option 
      - enter IP of the "N.Virginia_1" EC2
Record Type : A
TTL:"1m"
```
- Select newly created record's flag and hit the "create record" 
tab seen bottom

- After show "info.[your DNS name].net" on the browser, "Delete" this record 


### STEP 3: Add another IP (N. Virginia_2)  to the existing "A record" 

- select "www.[your DNS name].net" A-record ---> Edit

```bash
Name:"www"
Value/Route traffic to:
    "IP of N.Virginia_1" ,and 
    "IP of N.Virginia_2"
```

- Check from local terminal
nslookup www.[your DNS name].net an show two IP address 


## Part 4 - Creating a CNAME Record:

- Add CNAME record for "Domain Name" 

- click your Domain name's public hosted zone

- click "create record"

- select "simple routing" ---> Next

- click "Define simple record"

```bash
Record Name:"showcname"
Value/Route traffic to: 
  - "IP address or another value depending on the record type"
    - enter "www.[your DNS name].net"
Record Type : "CNAME"-Routes to another domain and some AWS resources
TTL:"1m"
```
- hit the define simple record

- Select newly created record's flag and hit the "create record" 
tab seen bottom

- After show "showcname.[your DNS name].net" on the browser. It will reflects the "www.[your DNS name].net". After that "Delete"  this record 

## Part 5 - Creating a Alias Record:

### STEP 1: Alias for S3 bucket 

- click your Domain name's public hosted zone

- click "create record"

- select "simple routing" ---> Next

- click "Define simple record"

```bash
Record Name:"www"
Value/Route traffic to: 
    - Alias to *****S3 Website Endpoint*******
    - US East (N.Virginia) [us-east-1]
    - choose your S3 bucket named "www.[your DNS name].net"
Record Type : A
```
- hit the define simple record

- Select newly created record's flag and hit the "create record" 
tab seen bottom


- go to the target domain name "www.[your DNS name].net" on browser

- show the content of web page. It is the same as  S3 static web hosting page.

- ***Delete the Alias record 

### STEP 2: Alias for ELB  

- click your Domain name's public hosted zone

- click "create record"

- select "simple routing" ---> Next

- click "Define simple record"

```bash
Record Name:"www"
Value/Route traffic to: 
    - Alias to ***** ELB Endpoint*******
    - US East (N.Virginia) [us-east-1]
    - choose your S3 bucket named "www.[your DNS name].net"
Record Type : A
```
- hit the define simple record

- Select newly created record's flag and hit the "create record" 
tab seen bottom


- go to the target domain name "www.[your DNS name].net" on browser

- show the content of web page. It is the same as S3 static web hosting page.

### STEP 3: Cleaning 
- Delete CloudFormation Stack
- Delete Instances.
- Delete bucket 
- Delete A,CNAME and Alias record If they exist. 
- Check the load balancer again
