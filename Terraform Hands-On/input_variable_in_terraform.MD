#### In Terraform, input variables are used to pass values from outside of the configuration or module. They allow for dynamic values to be assigned to resource attributes. Input variables are essential for customizing infrastructure configurations and accepting values before the code execution. Here is an example of how to define an input variable in Terraform:

```
variable "ami" {
  type        = string
  description = "AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  default     = "ami-0d26eb3972b7f8c96"
  validation {
    condition     = length(var.ami) > 4 && substr(var.ami, 0, 4) == "ami-"
    error_message = "Please provide a valid value for variable AMI."
  }
}
```

In this example, an input variable named 'ami' is defined with a string type, a description, a default value, and validation rules to ensure the provided value meets specific criteria. Input variables play a crucial role in customizing deployments and making configurations more flexible and adaptable.
