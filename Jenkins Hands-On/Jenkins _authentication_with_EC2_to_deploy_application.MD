# To authenticate with EC2/K8s to deploy an application using Jenkins pipeline, you need to configure the necessary credentials in Jenkins. Here are the general steps to achieve this:

1. Create an IAM user in AWS:
In your AWS console, create an IAM user with the necessary permissions to deploy your application to EC2/K8s. Make sure to save the access key and secret key for this user.

2. Configure credentials in Jenkins:
In your Jenkins instance, go to **"Credentials" > "System" > "Global credentials (unrestricted)" > "Add Credentials."**
Select **"AWS Credentials"** as the kind and enter the access key and secret key for the IAM user you created in step 1.

3. Configure the Jenkins pipeline:
In your Jenkinsfile, use the **withAWS() or withCredentials()** step to authenticate with AWS using the credentials you configured in step 2.

Use the **AWS CLI** or **SDK** to deploy your application to EC2/K8s.

### Here is an example of a Jenkinsfile that uses the withAWS() step to deploy an application to EC2:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        AWS_DEFAULT_REGION = 'us-east-1'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Deploy to EC2') {
            steps {
                withAWS(credentials: 'aws-credentials') {
                    sh 'aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-key-pair --security-group-ids sg-12345678 --subnet-id subnet-12345678'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### In this example, the withAWS() step authenticates with AWS using the aws-credentials credentials that were configured in Jenkins. The sh step then uses the AWS CLI to run an EC2 instance
