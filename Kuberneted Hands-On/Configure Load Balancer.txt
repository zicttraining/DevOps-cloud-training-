#### To configure a Kubernetes Load Balancer, you need to define a Service in a YAML configuration file with the type field set to LoadBalancer. 

Here's an example YAML configuration file for a Load Balancer that exposes a web application:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webapp-service
  annotations:
    service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-load-balancer-internal: "true"
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  loadBalancerIP: 192.168.1.1
  loadBalancerSourceRanges:
  - 192.168.2.0/24
  selector:
    app: webapp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080


### In this example, a Service named "webapp-service" is defined with a selector that targets pods labeled with app: webapp. The Service exposes port 80, which is the port used by clients to access the service, and forwards the traffic to the pods' port 8080. The type field is set to LoadBalancer, and the loadBalancerIP and loadBalancerSourceRanges fields are used to specify the IP address and source IP ranges for the Load Balancer.


### After creating the Service definition, you can apply it to your Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl apply command. The Load Balancer will be created and configured automatically by Kubernetes, provided your cluster runs in a supported environment and is configured with the correct cloud load balancer provider package.
