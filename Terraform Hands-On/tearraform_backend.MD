# To configure a Terraform backend with Terraform commands, you can use the remote backend type. 

Here is an example of how to set up a remote backend in Terraform:

1. Define Backend Configuration:

Create a configuration file, for example, config.remote.tfbackend, with the following   content:
 ```
 backend "remote" {
  hostname = "app.terraform.io"
  organization = "company"
  workspaces {
    name = "workspace"
  }
}
```

2. Run **'terraform init'** with Backend Configuration:

Initialize Terraform with the backend configuration file using the following command:
```
terraform init -backend-config=config.remote.tfbackend
```
3. Utilize Remote Backend Commands:

 #### The remote backend supports various Terraform commands like 'apply', 'console', 'destroy', 'plan', and more. These commands can be executed with the remote backend configuration to manage infrastructure effectively.
